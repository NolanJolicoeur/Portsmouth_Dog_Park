# Dog_Park
This is a project for the Portsmouth Dog Park.  
I was tasked with creating a dashboard to display a collection of manually uploaded data.
The data was used to win grants that were used for the expansion of the park. 
I tried my best to annotate as much as possible.  
The main file that is running as a live dashboard is labeled "app.R".
